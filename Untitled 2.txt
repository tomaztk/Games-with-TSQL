T-SQL functions

Mathematical (abs, cos, sin, pi, rand, power, ceiling,…)
Ranking and Analytical (lag, lead, first_value, dense_rank, rank, row_number, …)
Aggregate (avg, count, max,min, grouping, var, stdev,…)
String (replace, ltrim, rtrim,stuff, substring, nchar, patindex,…)

What about matrix() ?
And dictionary? Tuples? Lists?

Matrix
Scripting languages (R, Python, JS, Julia, …) have matrix
Can iterate matrix[i][y], read, write
T-SQL ?
CREATE TABLE
POPULATE TABLE
Function to get data from the table

>>> Show demo with Py vs. SQL matrix


Arrays, tuples, dictionaries

a=[] or a=[[]] or a = c(1,2,3,4,3,3,1,2,1,3)
T-SQL
Can not declare an empty dictionary
Create table, store results and get the results back in dictionary manner
Does not support multiple arrays of arrays (Postgres does!)
There are no data types as dictionaries
T-SQL solutions:
Tables
Strings of values (that can be concatenated/split) in single cell
